## First of all
This app is our final project for [Advanced Programming](https://github.com/Advanced-Programming-1402) course at Shahid Beheshti University. The program is based on Java and we also used some other languages such as CSS, C++ and Html.
<br>The design pattern used for this project is MVC. For further information on this design pattern check the ***????*** section.
<br>There is also a powerpoint of our presentation which you can see [here]().

## The Process
### Phase 1
At the beggining of the projects, we had several meetings discussing different subjects such as:
1. Which design pattern should we use?
<br>There was a wide range of patterns we could use, patterns like Bridge, Abstract factory, Composite and so on. At last we picked MVC design pattern(short for model-view-controler).
<br>MVC separates the different aspects of an application (data, UI, and logic), making the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
Since the components are independent, changes to one component do not affect the others, allowing for easier updates and modifications and since the parts are seperated, multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously, which makes this pattern our finest option to work on as a group.
2. How should we manage the database?
3. Basic map of the program and division of labour
